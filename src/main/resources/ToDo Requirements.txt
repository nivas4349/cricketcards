============= Many Modifications are Anticipated ===============
Phase 1(Only ODIs):
-------------------
* DB end to end design
	- Player table(ID(Incremental), CricInfoId, Full Name, Country, DOB, 
		Batting style, Bowling style, Height, playing role) 
	- table for ODIs (id, Id_player, Type of player, category of player, Statistics - Mat, Notouts, 
		Runs, Highest, Bat.Ave, Strike rate, 100, 50, 4s, 6s, Catch, Stumpings, Balls Bowled,
		Wickets, Best Bowling, Bowl Ave, Econ)
	//- table for user authentication
	- table for user management(id, coins balance, coins earned, Coins spent) 
	- table to track cards(using id in ODIs table) unlocked by that user
----------------------
	- type of player
		1. Batsman
		2. Bowler
		3. All-Rounder
		4. Keeper
	- category of Player - coin mapping
		5. Diamond,16x,32x,16x 
		1. Platinum,8x,250x,125x
		2. Gold,4x,50x,25x
		3. Silver,2x,10x,5x
		4. Bronze,x,2x,x
------------------------------------------
* Sample Data for Dev Env
* SQL Queries to do CRUD operations
* Java DTO - Do all Java code in GIT
* Entity Manager(Hibernate Setup)
* RESTful APIs (For player insert/update, single click update statistics of all players,	
	User Management(Including admin (Only Myself)) - SignUp Process(Facebook, google, 
	Cricket Cards account), login process, retrieve account, forgot pwd)
* Authentication (These APIs should be really secured, and only accessible by only 
	our 3 Clients)
* Role based Authorization
* Batch for periodic statistic updates for all players
* batch for updating category of players depending on rules()
* Look for open source code evaluators

Phase 2(UI for WebAPP, Android, iOS):
-------------------------------------
* Hire art designer for card look (look should be close to cricket card battle)
* Do research on UX, on how the motion of card should be
* First complete end to end WebAPP, include PIWIK user action tracking
* Do thorough analysis to find out how single code change reflects for all the UIs used,
	like when we do code change, it should reflect in Android, iOS Apps.  

Phase 3(Review Performance, Plan on business model and release to App store, Google Play):
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Review and tune performance
* Do research and choose the right business model (Available App Store/Google play revenue
	models)
* you can count on ad hosting for income in your webapp, ios, android apps
* Take care of copy right issues
* deploy and release to App store, google play

Phase 4(Multi Player):
----------------------
Track who is online and invite friend for a game
award 5 bronze card equivalent coins(For EX: 100 for each card) for 50 max/day invitations 
sent, and award 10 bronze card equivalent coins(For EX: 100 for each card) for each new
